Lab 1: Create a 2D grid space where a pseudo-bot operates. The pseudo-bot moves randomly one cell at a time if no walls are detected. Depending on the configuration of the 8 adjacent cells, the pseudo-bot will make a decision about where to move next. Once a wall is reached the pseudo-bot will move in a counter-clockwise motion around the wall indefinately.
